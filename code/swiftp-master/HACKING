SETUP ANDROID STUDIO
====================
How to use Android Studio with the SwiFTP project:

1) Fork the project to your own account and clone:
        git clone git@github.com:<youraccount>/swiftp.git
2) In Android studio open the project:
  - File -> Open
3) Add the lombok plugin to Android Studio:
  - File -> Settings -> Plugins -> Browse Repositories
  - Search Lombok Plugin and install

DOCUMENTATION
=============
We make use of the lombok val keyword. See
     https://projectlombok.org/features/val
We don't use this everywhere, only when writing the
declaration would require a linewrap and when the
context is clear and when the usage of the variable
is close to the declaration.

Retrolambda is being used to enable us to use
the java 8 lambda construct. You should read up
on this and then enjoy this in your own code. Java 8
is comming to android, so this library will soon not be
needed anymore. The code changes should be minimal.
